# CARBON CREDIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# **Introduction** 
The world is getting polluted heavily and each one of us is responsible for adding the pollution into the environment knowingly or unknowingly. It is high time we realize our contribution to carbonizing the mother earth and take remedial steps to build back the green earth.

Many of the developed countries made it mandatory that individuals, institutions and organizations compute their positive and negative contributions to the environment and the negative contributions in excess will be penalized where as positive contributions can be transferred or sold to others and make some wealth. 

These positive and negative contributions to the environment from each individual or household or organization are referred to as “Carbon Credits”.


# **CCMS**
As part of fulfillment of Class XII, Computer Science studies, a Carbon Credit Management System (CCMS) is being developed to gather the carbon credits of individuals and organizations, compute them and display in various statistical graphs.

The Carbon Credit Management System has 3 modules for Data Acquisition, Data Enrichment and Data Presentation.

Module 1 collects the data related to carbon contribution by individuals and institutions/organizations, contributions to both environmental pollution and its control. The data is stored in database and files (for static data)

Module 2 calculates the carbon credits (and offsets) for individuals and institutions/organizations and stores data in database.

Module 3 displays the data in various formats and shows alerts for different thresholds.
